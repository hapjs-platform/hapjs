## Collaborator nominations

Existing collaborators can nominate someone to become a collaborator. Nominees should have significant and valuable contributions across the hapjs-platform organization.

To nominate a new collaborator, open an issue in the [hapjs-platform/hapjs][] repository. Provide a summary of the nominee's contributions. For example:

* Commits in the [hapjs-platform/hapjs][] repository.
  * Use the link `https://github.com/hapjs-platform/hapjs/commits?author=GITHUB_ID`
* Pull requests and issues opened in the [hapjs-platform/hapjs][] repository.
  * Use the link `https://github.com/hapjs-platform/hapjs/issues?q=author:GITHUB_ID`
* Comments on pull requests and issues in the [hapjs-platform/hapjs][] repository
  * Use the link `https://github.com/hapjs-platform/hapjs/issues?q=commenter:GITHUB_ID`
* Reviews on pull requests in the [hapjs-platform/hapjs][] repository
  * Use the link `https://github.com/hapjs-platform/hapjs/pulls?q=reviewed-by:GITHUB_ID`
* Help provided to end-users and novice contributors
* Pull requests and issues opened throughout the hapjs-platform organization
  * Use the link  `https://github.com/search?q=author:GITHUB_ID+org:hapjs-platform`
* Comments on pull requests and issues throughout the hapjs-platform organization
  * Use the link `https://github.com/search?q=commenter:GITHUB_ID+org:hapjs-platform`
* Participation in other projects, teams, and working groups of the hapjs-platform
  organization
* Other participation in the wider hapjs-platform community

The nomination passes if no collaborators oppose it after one week. Otherwise, the nomination fails.

There are steps a nominator can take in advance to make a nomination as frictionless as possible. A nominator may also work with thenominee to improve their contribution profile.

Collaborators might overlook someone with valuable contributions. In that case, the contributor may open an issue or contact a collaborator to request a nomination.
